## Getting Started
We've tried to make it _super easy_ to get up and running on this [challenge](https://github.com/MeanPug/meanpug-wordpress-developer-challenge). Simply
`cd` to the directory, and run the `docker-compose up -d` to bring up a fully functional Wordpress environment at `localhost:8000`, complete with 
a Gulp build system and Tailwind + PostCSS CSS integration.
